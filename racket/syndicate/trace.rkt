;; A NotificationType is one of
;; -- 'turn-begin
;; -- 'turn-end
;; -- 'spawn
;; -- 'exit
;; -- 'action
;; -- 'event
;; -- 'influence
;;
;; The trace-notification-detail field is used differently for each
;; NotificationType:
;; -- 'turn-begin and 'turn-end --> Process
;; -- 'spawn --> (list PID Process), the parent's PID and the process' initial state
;; -- 'exit --> Option Exception
;; -- 'action --> (U Event 'quit) (notably, spawns are handled otherwise)
;; -- 'event --> Event
;; -- 'influence --> Event
;;
;; The source and sink fields both hold values of type ActorPath. They
;; are, again, used differently for each NotificationType:
;; -- 'turn-begin --> source is dataspace; sink the process whose turn it is
;; -- 'turn-end --> source is dataspace; sink the process whose turn it was
;; -- 'spawn --> source is dataspace; sink the new process
;; -- 'exit --> source is dataspace; sink the exiting process
;; -- 'action --> source is acting process; sink is dataspace (NB: Flipped!)
;; -- 'event --> source is dataspace; sink is receiving process
;; -- 'influence --> source is acting process; sink is receiving process
;;
;; For 'influence, when the detail event is a patch, the source field
;; is not always the true influencing party. In the case where a
;; process adds new observe assertions to a dataspace where matching
;; assertions already exist, it will appear to "influence itself".
;; Really, with patches, it's the PIDs at the leaves of each patch's
;; tries that are the influencers.
